### How to Update Categories in Google Business Profile

1. **Sign in to Google Business Profile**
   - Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com)
   - Or search for your business on Google and click "Manage this business"

2. **Navigate to Business Information**
   - Click on "Edit profile" or "Business information"
   - Find the "Category" section

3. **Set Primary Category**
   - **Primary Category (keep one only):**
     - ✅ **Notary Public**

4. **Add Secondary Categories**
   - Click "Add another category"
   - Add the following secondary categories:
     - ✅ **Legal Services**
     - ✅ **Document Services**
     - ✅ **Consultant** (optional)

### Important Notes

- **Primary Category**: Only one primary category should be selected. Keep "Notary Public" as the primary.
- **Secondary Categories**: You can add multiple secondary categories. These help Google understand your full range of services.
- **Category Selection**: Make sure the categories match exactly as listed above for best results.

### Why These Categories Matter

- **Notary Public**: Primary category that matches your core service
- **Legal Services**: Helps with searches for legal document services
- **Document Services**: Captures searches for document processing and authentication
- **Consultant**: Optional category that can help with advisory service searches

### Schema Markup Alignment

The website's LocalBusiness schema has been updated to align with these categories:
- Added "LegalService" as an additional @type
- Added service types: "Legal Services" and "Document Services"
- Added service catalog with detailed offerings

This helps ensure consistency between your GBP profile and your website's structured data.
